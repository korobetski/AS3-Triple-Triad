Fan made Final Fantasy VIII &amp; XIV Triple Triad in AS3 AIR.
Many assets belongs to Square Enix

Last version (v4) of a project started in 2009.
Originaly the goal of this project was to learn how to code in ActionScript 3 in a funny way.

Developped with FlashDevelop : http://www.flashdevelop.org/
Using Starling Framework : https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework
And Feathers UI : https://feathersui.com/

This version contains many features :
- Multi Saves system
- FF8 Cards and Rules
- FF14 Cards and Rules
- Decks
- Achievements System
- Many Bots from FF14 & FF8

This may contains bugs...
Actually the Online feature is broken due to the lack of server (Originally a python Palabre socket server) and the code was simply copy/paste from the v3.
The developpement process is stopped since 2015, so i decided to share the source code, maybe it can be usefull to someone.
